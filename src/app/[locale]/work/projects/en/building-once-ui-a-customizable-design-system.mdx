## Overview

The Vertex Sports Centre Management System was developed as part of the COMP2913 Software Engineering Principles Group Project. It serves as a robust application for managing sports center operations, including user account creation, role-based access control, and booking management. Designed with Python and Flask, this project emphasizes seamless integration between back-end and front-end components while prioritizing accessibility and user-friendly design.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based User Management**: Separate functionalities for public users and managers, ensuring data integrity and secure operations.
- **Booking Workflow**: Intuitive interfaces for users to book facilities and sessions, with administrative tools for managers to oversee operations.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Designed and tested for compliance with WCAG standards, ensuring inclusivity for all users.
- **Custom PDF Generation**: Implementation of downloadable booking receipts using lightweight and universally compatible libraries.
- **Email Verification**: Secure and efficient account activation via email verification using environment variables for enhanced security.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-first design approach using Bootstrap for a consistent experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Python & Flask**: Core framework for developing the back-end API and managing server-side logic.
- **HTML5, CSS3, & Bootstrap**: Front-end technologies for creating a responsive and accessible user interface.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database solution for handling application data.
- **Pytest**: Testing framework for ensuring code reliability.

## Challenges and Learnings

### Challenges:
- **Email Verification**: Initial difficulty in setting up environment variables and handling repository secrets for secure email functionality. Overcame this with iterative testing and research.
- **PDF Generation**: Faced issues with dependencies like `pdfkit` and `wkhtml2pdf` due to complex installation routines, eventually implementing a lightweight solution for portability.

### Learnings:
- Enhanced knowledge of full-stack development, particularly in integrating Flask back-end logic with dynamic front-end interfaces.
- Gained practical experience in designing role-specific workflows and implementing security features like email verification.
- Developed leadership and team coordination skills by managing deadlines, organizing meetings, and resolving bottlenecks.
- Improved understanding of Agile Scrum methodology, including the importance of iterative development and documentation.

## Outcome

The Vertex Sports Centre Management System successfully streamlined sports center operations by providing a robust and accessible platform for users and managers. The project was completed within the allocated timeline, meeting all functional and non-functional requirements. This experience reinforced my technical expertise in Python Flask systems, strengthened my teamwork and leadership skills, and provided valuable insights into overcoming real-world development challenges.
